### NextJS Template with prettier, eslint, tailwindcss and typescript with config preset
This is the Template from DarkModz-Official
## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Now Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Some ESLint / Prettier errors can be fixed by running:

`npx eslint --fix .`

## Useful Information
The `.placeholder` file is used to keep the `public` and `components` folder in the git repository.

The `public` folder is used to store static files like images, fonts, etc. and the `components` folder is used to store all components that are used in the pages.
